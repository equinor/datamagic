# Data Magic with Python - an introduction

Requirement for attending:
- you have a GitHub account connected to the Equinor organization
- you have some basic skill in Python or another programming language already

Here are some of the topics we will cover:
- Using a cloud based developing environment
- Accessing an Azure Data Storage
- Working on the Unix command line
- Writing small Python scripts
- Developing a proper tool in Python
- Spin up a simple web application with Flask
- Interactive Python with numpy and matplotlib

There will be a couple of break out sessions with groups to do some simple exercises.
I hope for an interactive session and I will try to explain things carefully as we go.

Experienced Python programmers, software engineers and data scientists are particularly welcome to this course - I need your insight and expertise to add depth to the conversation, but also to help out with the group exercise.
